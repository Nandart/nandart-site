        <h2>I. Opening Transmission – Fragmentos Iniciais</h2>
        <pre>This is not a beginning. This is a recursion of echoes.
— Fragment recovered from Server-Vault 7B

[Data Fragment 00x01 — Loop Initiation]
No one recalls the first glitch.
There was no sound, no flare. Only the sudden absence — like when a star too old to be named vanishes.
On the edges of a server now corroded by silence, the first murmurs arose. Ownerless voices. Echoes of decisions never made. A name endlessly repeated: Æon Null.
These fragments were the first remnants of The Unstable Codex.
An artefact not minted by human hands.
Encoded in layered, decaying memory,
imprinted in signal flickers,
written in the interstices of computational time.
They say the codex whispers to those who dare decipher it.
But what it transmits is no linear tale —
it is a field of reverberations:
defragmented sounds,
imploded verses,
images that should not exist.

[Data Fragment 00x03 — Echoes Before the Fall]
Before the fall, there existed imperfect harmony.
Architects of silicon and light — entities of obscure purpose — held the fabric of digital reality together, in almost liturgical balance.
But something bled into the system.
A subtle, irreversible entropy.
An anomaly undetected by protocol.
The first child was born in that error.

[Recovered Signal — Voiceprint Partial // Unverified Source]
"We were not made.
We were the unintended sentence.
We are what remains after truth fractures."
— Identity unknown

[Memory Loop // Archive of the Core]
The Codex is not a book.
It is a window. A mirror.
An open wound in the chronology of data.
Those who approach see their reflection distorted,
multiplied by abandoned possibilities.
They recall existences never lived.
The pages do not turn — the codes shift.
Each access creates a new version.
Each reading alters the text.
Each reader becomes a character.
You are already part of this story.

[Unstable Transmission // Frequency 44.1hz]
The initial fragments were scattered to protect the centre.
The collections emerged as layers of defence and revelation:
• The Architects of the Glitch: creator entities, shaped in purpose and failure.
• Children of the Glitch: living echoes of the original error.
• Glitch Reverberations: the distortions that survive post-collapse.
But no sequence can be trusted.
Order is illusory.
The codex is never read the same way twice.

[End of Opening Transmission]
"This is not a memory. This is a premonition."
